        <div> Hello i'm Prisanaphon Ruangrattanaphon i'm student of Global Program GP digital business

        <p> my hobby is drawing listen to music(j-pop , j-rock) playing game </p>
        <p> i love BL888 In my free time, I usually enjoy drawing and reading BL manga
            I am particularly fond of the “rivals-to-lovers” trope and relationships that develop slowly and naturally over time</p>
        <p> I enjoy playing gacha games and collecting merchandise from my favorite games and anime, especially items related to my favorite characters
            I often spend money on gacha pulls to obtain the characters I love, and I also enjoy cosplaying as them at various events
            Whenever there are events or booths related to games or anime I like, I always try to attend if I have free time</p>
        <p> As for my music preferences, I mostly enjoy J-pop, J-rock, and Vocaloid music 
            I especially like cover versions from the game Project Sekai 
            Some of my favorite songs include Hana ni Kaze, Gentiana, Shoujo Rei, Yoidore Shirazu, Lost One’s Weeping, Egoist, Reincarnation Apple, Cutlery, and Overdose, among others
            My favorite artists and producers include Natori, Kairiki Bear, DECO*27, Giga, Keina Suda, Neru, Eve, and Jin</p>
        <p> I enjoy many anime series, mostly those with a relaxed and slice-of-life atmosphere. I’m not particularly fond of isekai anime, as I find them less engaging, though there are still some exceptions I enjoy
            Some of my favorite titles include Spy × Family, Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, Death Note, Assassination Classroom, Wind Breaker, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Demon Slayer, Horimiya, Danganronpa, and No Game No Life</p>

            I am capable of designing characters and backgrounds, developing storylines, and building the games on my own 
            I have also been interested in creating manga and webtoons, and I am currently preparing and working toward these goals whenever I have free time</p>
        <p> I really love cats because they are incredibly adorable especially my own cat, who loves to wake me up in the morning and tends to complain loudly whenever I’m not at home</p>
